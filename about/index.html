<p><span class="italic">FIRST</span> LEGO League Newfoundland and Labrador (FLLNL) is a division of Levitate Learning, a volunteer-driven,
not-for-profit organization based in St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.</p>
<p>FLLNL strives to promote interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) amongst youth in Newfoundland
and Labrador. For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (<span class="italic">FIRST</span>) is a global non-profit organization
that was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in the United States. Through the delivery of their various robotics
programs and their adherence to their core values, <span class="italic">FIRST</span> has been instrumental in exposing STEM to young people all over
the world, while developing students’ problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and leadership skills.</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador has been participating in <span class="italic">FIRST</span> LEGO League since the early 2000s.</p>
<h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
<p>The Mission of FLLNL is to inspire young people of Newfoundland and Labrador to pursue studies and careers in the
field of science, technology, engineering, and math. This will be achieved by engaging youth in exciting mentor-based
programs that build technical skills such as research, engineering, and problem-solving, as well as professional skills
such as communication, leadership, and teamwork. These programs will promote innovation and self-confidence.</p>
<h2 id="our-vision">Our Vision</h2>
<p>The vision of FLLNL is to build a space that celebrates STEM skills, where young people feel encouraged and welcome
to pursue innovative solutions to the world’s problems.</p>
<h2 id="our-values">Our Values</h2>
<p>One of the critical differences between <span class="italic">FIRST</span> and other robotics programs is the adherence to six core values that
are expressed through philosophies of <b>Gracious Professionalism<span class="rtrademark"></span></b> and
<b>Coopertition<span class="rtrademark"></span></b>.</p>
<p>The core values of <span class="italic">FIRST</span> emphasize friendly sportsmanship, respect for the contributions of others, teamwork,
learning, and community involvement. They are part of <span class="italic">FIRST</span>’s commitment to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a
culture of equity, diversity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>The Core Values of <span class="italic">FIRST</span> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Discovery</b>: We explore new skills and ideas.</li>
<li><b>Innovation</b>: We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.</li>
<li><b>Impact</b>: We apply what we learn to improve our world.</li>
<li><b>Inclusion</b>: We respect each other and embrace our differences.</li>
<li><b>Teamwork</b>: We are stronger when we work together.</li>
<li><b>Fun</b>: We enjoy and celebrate what we do!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Gracious Professionalism<span class="rtrademark"></span></b> was coined by Dr. Woodie Flowers and is a pillar of all
<span class="italic">FIRST</span> programs. Dr. Woodie was Co-Chair of the <span class="italic">FIRST</span> Executive Advisory Board, Distinguished Advisor to <span class="italic">FIRST</span>,
and Pappalardo Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Gracious Professionalism<span class="rtrademark"></span> encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others,
and respects individuals and the community. Through Gracious Professionalism<span class="rtrademark"></span>, fierce
competition and mutual gain coexist. Participants compete intensely while treating each other with respect and empathy.
There is no trash talking, nor disingenuous platitudes. Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended.</p>
<p><b>Coopertition<span class="rtrademark"></span></b> fosters innovation by promoting unqualified kindness and respect in
the face of intense competition. That means that teams help, and cooperate with each other, even as they compete. It’s
about learning from teammates, teaching others, collaborating with mentors, managing and being managed.
Coopertition<span class="rtrademark"></span> embodies the spirit of competing while assisting and enabling others
whenever possible.</p> </article> </div> </div> </main> </body></html>
