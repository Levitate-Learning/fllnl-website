# Volunteering

<FIRST/> volunteers empower students to embrace discovery, innovation, and collaboration. They help <FIRST/>
participants develop leadership and problem-solving skills, and foster self-confidence. <FIRST/> volunteers energize and
inspire the next generation to use these skills to build a better future â€“ and along the way, volunteers get energized
and inspired themselves.

Even if you only have a few hours to give, your contribution can make a difference.

## Why Volunteer?

It takes all of us to work in collaboration to build a thriving community, and everyone has a role to play. <FIRST/>
event volunteers support our teams and create a ripple effect that carries young people through uncharted waters to
bring ideas to life. As a volunteer, you will:

* Empower students to be good global citizens who understand that they can use their collective skills to make a
  positive impact in the world.
* Join a community of like-minded individuals that support <FIRST/> programs.
* Receive general <FIRST/> training and training for your volunteer role.
* Have access to certificates of volunteerism and other recognition items.
* Receive <FIRST/> Lego League swag.
* The <FIRST/> Lego League Challenge Competition.

Every November, teams of students (grades 4-9) across the province of Newfoundland and Labrador engage in research,
problem-solving, coding, and engineering to build a <LEGO /> robot that navigates the missions of a robot game.

The 2024 <FIRSTLEGO /> League Newfoundland and Labrador (<FLLNL />) Competition is Saturday, November 23, from 8:30am -
4:30 pm.

## Safety

Every volunteer must become familiar with the <FIRST/>
[Youth Protection Program](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-protection-policy). All volunteers 18
and over from the United States and Canada must complete background screening for the safety of all <FIRST/>
participants.
