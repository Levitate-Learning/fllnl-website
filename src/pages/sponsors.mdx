# Sponsorship

Our heartfelt thanks to all the sponsors, suppliers, partners, and individuals who have helped us make an impact on the
youth of Newfoundland and Labrador.

Looking to make a difference in the lives of youth in Newfoundland and Labrador? Want to inspire the next generation of
scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs? Consider being a sponsor for <FIRSTLEGO/> League Newfoundland and Labrador.

<FIRSTLEGO/> League Newfoundland and Labrador (<FLLNL/>) is run through a non-profit organization, Levitate Learning.
Levitate Learning cannot deliver its STEM-based programming to the youth of our province without the generous support of
sponsors. From the materials the teams need to compete to the award plaques at the competition, a program like <FLLNL/>
is an expensive endeavour. But the experience and skills the participantâ€™s gain is well worth the cost.

## Benefits of Sponsorship

* Strengthens company bonds within the community
* Builds a technologically literate workforce
* Exposes career opportunities to youth
* Provides employee team building opportunities
* Provides renewed inspiration to employees
* Supports youth within our province

## What does <FIRST/> Robotics Program mean to Newfoundland & Labrador

<FIRSTLEGO/> League was designed to teach the skills that employers are searching for: critical thinking, teamwork,
communication, and a great work ethic.

To help us grow robotics programs in Newfoundland and Labrador, we are looking for industry sponsors. Industry support
can be in the form of:

* Financial support towards items such as:
  * <LEGO/> robotics kits, robot challenge kits, team registration, equipment, etc.
  * Awards, plaques, medals and trophies presented to participating teams
  * Food and drinks for the 40+ volunteers at the competition
  * Equipment, materials, facilities for competition
* In-kind support in the form of:
  * Goods and services to run the competition
  * Technical expertise provided to teams in preparation for the competition

Designing a robot is more than just connecting <LEGO/>, the missions require the robot to navigate, capture, transport,
or deliver objects. The more missions completed, the more points teams earn. Teams have 2.5 minutes to complete as many
mission tasks as they can.

**All in-kind donations will be counted at an agreed upon monetary value and applied to the tiers above.**

## Material Donations

Looking to help out in a more concrete way? Consider the following sponsorship/donation items. <FLLNL/> will put your
donation towards a specific item to reduce the barrier to entry for a team. Note that material donations are limited
based on the number of participating teams.

**The value of all material donations will be applied to the tiers above.**

### Purchase a Challenge Kit- $200

A Challenge Kit includes the mat for the robot game and all the <LEGO/> required to build the mission models. Teams need
at least one Challenge Kit to practise with, and the competition needs 12 Challenge Kits to operate. If you would like
to build the mission models for a competition Challenge Kit (an excellent teamwork exercise for employees), <FLLNL/>
can deliver the kit to you.

### Purchase a base SPIKE Prime Kit - $600

Each team needs at least the base SPIKE Prime Kit, to participate in the <FLLNL/> competition. This kit includes the
programmable brick, 3 motors, some sensors, and nearly 500 <LEGO/> pieces.

### Purchase a SPIKE Prime Expansion Kit - $300

While a base kit is required for a team to participate in the <FLLNL/> competition, an expansion kit gives a team access
to more sensors, more motors, and more <LEGO/> pieces to build tools.

### Purchase a Team Registration - $400
<FIRST/> registration fees are outside the control of <FLLNL/> and these fees do not directly contribute to local
delivery of programming. These fees are often a barrier to entry for teams.
