### What is the FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge?

The FIRST® LEGO® League Challenge is a robotics competition that teaches science, technology, engineering, and math
(STEM) skills to kids aged 9-14 (grades 4-9) in a fun, hands-on, way. The competition is broken into four categories:
innovation project, robot design, core values demonstration, and robot game performance.

Each year, FIRST® LEGO® League issues a new Challenge based on a real-world theme. Teams of up to 10 students must
research a problem associated with that theme and create a solution that they present to a panel of judges. Students
must design, build, and program a LEGO®  robot to accomplish the tasks of a game within 2.5 minutes. The tasks are all
based on the year's theme. Not only do teams need to show their robot can perform, they must also describe their design
decisions to a panel of judges. Finally, teams must consistently demonstrate the core values of FIRST® (discovery,
innovation, impact, inclusion, teamwork, and fun), while expressing Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® (simply
put, good sportsmanship).

Students who participate in FIRST® LEGO® League build technical and soft skills, discover exciting career possibilities,
and learn how to make a positive impact in their communities.
