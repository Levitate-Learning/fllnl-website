## What is FIRST LEGO League Challenge?

FIRST LEGO League Challenge is a robotics competition which challenges grade 4 - 9 students to create and
communicate solutions to real world problems using LEGO-based robots. Through their imaginations and adult coaches,
students who participate in FIRST Lego League build technical and soft skills, discover exciting career
possibilities, and learn how to make a positive impact for their communities.

This season students participating in FIRST LEGO League will explore and solve problems relating to our oceans in
this season, SUBMERGED.

## Why start a FIRST LEGO League Challenge Team?

The FIRST LEGO League Challenge competition gives students the opportunity to work collaboratively and have fun
doing it! There are many reasons to start a FIRST LEGO League Challenge team, including: increased engagement,
improved technical, communication, problem solving and collaboration skills, and to inspire your students to pursue
careers in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math.
