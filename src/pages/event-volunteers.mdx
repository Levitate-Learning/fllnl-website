# Event Volunteers

It takes many people to pull off a <FIRSTLEGO /> League Challenge competition, so volunteers are needed to prepare,
participate, and put away. There are several volunteer roles required for an <FLLNL /> Challenge Competition, so even if
you only have a short time to give, you can get involved.

## Robot Game Referee

The centre of excitement of any <FLLNL /> event is around the game table, where teams put their robots to the test! If
you want to be at the centre of the action, refereeing the Robot Game may be for you. As a referee, you will observe
robot game matches, identify rule violations, and score the matches based on a rubric. This role is supported by a Head
Referee, who will assist in rule clarifications.

This role requires you to:

* Be on your feet for around 6 hours on competition day (breaks, food, and water provided).
* Understand robot game rules with training and resources provided by <FLLNL />.
* Complete 2 hours of orientation & training prior to competition day.

## Presentation Judge

If you want to be wowed by the ingenuity and creativity of young people, being a presentation judge is the job for you.
Teams work hard not only on their robot, but also identifying and solving a problem related to the year’s theme. They
will share what they have learned through group presentations and get valuable feedback on their
[Robot Design](https://www.first-lego-league.org/en/2024-25-season/challenge-resources/robot-design),
[Core Values](https://www.first-lego-league.org/en/2024-25-season/challenge-resources/core-values), and
[Innovation Project](https://www.first-lego-league.org/en/2024-25-season/challenge-resources/research) in a half-hour
judging session. Judges will assess teams’ work on rubrics and provide some immediate verbal feedback to encourage and
inspire them.

This role requires you to:

* Sit in a classroom setting for approximately 4 hours (breaks, food, and water provided).
* Watch student presentations and score them based on a rubric.
* Interview students to engage and encourage them in critical thinking.
* Attend orientation and training on competition day.
