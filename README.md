# First LEGO League Newfoundland and Labrador Website

https://fllnl.org/

This website was built using [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Commands

All commands must be run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |

## Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page will be exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, should be placed in the `public/` directory.
