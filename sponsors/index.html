<p>Our heartfelt thanks to all the sponsors, suppliers, partners, and individuals who have helped us make an impact on the
youth of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p>Looking to make a difference in the lives of youth in Newfoundland and Labrador? Want to inspire the next generation of
scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs? Consider being a sponsor for FIRST<span class="rtrademark"></span> LEGO<span class="rtrademark"></span> League Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
<p>FIRST<span class="rtrademark"></span> LEGO<span class="rtrademark"></span> League Newfoundland and Labrador (FLLNL) is run through a non-profit organization, Levitate Learning.
Levitate Learning cannot deliver its STEM-based programming to the youth of our province without the generous support of
sponsors. From the materials the teams need to compete to the award plaques at the competition, a program like FLLNL
is an expensive endeavour. But the experience and skills the participantâ€™s gain is well worth the cost.</p>

<p>Designing a robot is more than just connecting LEGO<span class="rtrademark"></span>, the missions require the robot to navigate, capture, transport,
or deliver objects. The more missions completed, the more points teams earn. Teams have 2.5 minutes to complete as many
mission tasks as they can.</p>
<p><strong>All in-kind donations will be counted at an agreed upon monetary value and applied to the tiers above.</strong></p>
<h2 id="material-donations">Material Donations</h2>
<p>Looking to help out in a more concrete way? Consider the following sponsorship/donation items. FLLNL will put your
donation towards a specific item to reduce the barrier to entry for a team. Note that material donations are limited
based on the number of participating teams.</p>
<p><strong>The value of all material donations will be applied to the tiers above.</strong></p>
<h3 id="purchase-a-challenge-kit--200">Purchase a Challenge Kit- $200</h3>
<p>A Challenge Kit includes the mat for the robot game and all the LEGO<span class="rtrademark"></span> required to build the mission models. Teams need
at least one Challenge Kit to practise with, and the competition needs 12 Challenge Kits to operate. If you would like
to build the mission models for a competition Challenge Kit (an excellent teamwork exercise for employees), FLLNL
can deliver the kit to you.</p>
<h3 id="purchase-a-base-spike-prime-kit---600">Purchase a base SPIKE Prime Kit - $600</h3>
<p>Each team needs at least the base SPIKE Prime Kit, to participate in the FLLNL competition. This kit includes the
programmable brick, 3 motors, some sensors, and nearly 500 LEGO<span class="rtrademark"></span> pieces.</p>
<h3 id="purchase-a-spike-prime-expansion-kit---300">Purchase a SPIKE Prime Expansion Kit - $300</h3>
<p>While a base kit is required for a team to participate in the FLLNL competition, an expansion kit gives a team access
to more sensors, more motors, and more LEGO<span class="rtrademark"></span> pieces to build tools.</p>
<h3 id="purchase-a-team-registration---400">Purchase a Team Registration - $400</h3>
<p>FIRST<span class="rtrademark"></span> registration fees are outside the control of FLLNL and these fees do not directly contribute to local
delivery of programming. These fees are often a barrier to entry for teams.</p>
